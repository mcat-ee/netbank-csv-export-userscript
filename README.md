# netbank-csv-export-userscript
A userscript for exporting transactions from the Commonwealth Netbank page

Please note: the functionality to export CSV files containing transactions is already present in Netbank, this script is intended to complement that by:
1. Automatically expanding the set of transactions displayed on the page (as the CSV export only exports the transactions currently displayed on the page).
